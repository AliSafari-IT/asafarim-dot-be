## üö¢ Deployment Steps

### **Phase 1: Pre-Deployment Verification**

```bash
# 1. Verify all tests pass
pnpm run test  # If configured
dotnet test    # For all APIs

# 2. Build all applications
pnpm run app:build

# 3. Verify builds are production-ready
ls -la dist/ build/ wwwroot/  # Check build outputs

# 4. Run database migrations (on production database)
dotnet ef database update --project apis/Core.Api
```

### **Phase 2: Production Deployment**

```bash
# 1. Backup production database
# (Use your backup strategy)

# 2. Deploy backend APIs first
# Copy built APIs to production servers
# Start API services

# 3. Deploy frontend applications
# Copy built frontend apps to web servers
# Configure reverse proxy

# 4. Verify deployment
# Check health endpoints
# Test critical user flows
```

### **Phase 3: Post-Deployment Verification**

- [ ] **Health Checks**
  - [ ] All applications respond to health check endpoints
  - [ ] Database connections are working
  - [ ] External APIs are accessible
  - [ ] Static assets load correctly

- [ ] **Functional Testing**
  - [ ] User registration/login works
  - [ ] Portfolio pages load correctly
  - [ ] Publication management functions properly
  - [ ] Resume publishing works (if enabled)

- [ ] **Performance Monitoring**
  - [ ] Response times are acceptable
  - [ ] Error rates are within acceptable thresholds
  - [ ] Resource usage is normal
  - [ ] Database performance is good

## üîÑ Rollback Plan

### **Immediate Rollback (if critical issues discovered)**

```bash
# 1. Stop all new application instances
# 2. Restore database from backup
# 3. Restart previous version of applications
# 4. Verify rollback success
```

### **Gradual Rollback (if non-critical issues)**

```bash
# 1. Deploy previous version alongside current
# 2. Gradually route traffic back to previous version
# 3. Monitor for issue resolution
# 4. Complete rollback if issues persist
```
